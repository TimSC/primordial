      *** What is Primordial Life? ***

  Primordial Life is actually two programs.  One program
runs Primordial Life as a screen saver and the other runs
Primordial Life inside a window on your Windows 95 or
Windows NT computer.

A help file included with Primordial Life which explains the
simulation in depth.  Just run Primordial Life and select help.  


     *** What is new in Primordial 4.0? ***

Plenty and too much to list here!


     *** Primordial Life Installation Instructions ***

Prim31.exe is a self extracting file.  Chances are you already
have installed this program since you are reading this file.
Prim31.exe will install the Windows program and related files
into the directory of your choice.  It will also install the
screen saver (Primordial Life 3,1.scr or PrimLife31.scr) into 
the \Windows\System for Win95 and into \Winnt\System32 directory
for WinNT.
