Description: Simulates biots in an artificial world
 Primordial Life presents an environment filled with artificially living creatures called biots. Like their biological counterparts, each biot has a genetic code that serves as a blueprint for constructing it. It is this blueprint which lays the foundation for their evolution.
 You will see biots battle to dominate the environment. Over time, new species will emerge while others may die out. Itâ€™s a tough life, but some "biots" got to do it.
 Evolving artificial life is not a light weight task for any computer. Primordial Life runs as a screen saver or in a window. You are in control of the environment in which your biots evolve and now you can connect your environment to others.
